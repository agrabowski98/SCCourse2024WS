stringtie /scratch/course/2023w300106/BAMS/SRR24348403.f.bam -l NemVecV1 -o NemAnnotation.gtf -p 6 -u -M 0

# -f what isoforms are accepted - less than 1 in 100 it is not accepted as a valid isoform
# -g max gap allowed between read mappings - like if there are no reads in a small area then if it is more than 50bp it will label it as two genes not continuation of 1 gene
# -M we remove multimap hits because we cannot be sure they map to a certain area - but removing them is a separate task
# -u we dont need because we are not using multimapping reads   
# first filter our bam files and write the filtered version of out file into new ABMS directory in the course folder
# yesterday made tim give multimapping reads get a mapping quality of 0 so now we can filter for mapping uality to discard what is under 20 (20 is linf like a 1:100 probability of being mapped wrong)
# flags - not all reads wil be good need a way to filter them out. IF you have both reads fwd and rev mapping to the same strand want to filter them out - for this can look for sam Flags in gogle will tell you the code 0x2 will only take proper pairs 
# unmapped reads should also have a 0 score so should already be excluded, but nonetheless we still exclude them with -F
# stringie will use al the bam files in the directory BAMS by using the *.bam
# but now if both are in one file then there is a problem some might be faster than others and then not all the BAM files will be available for the first peoples
# didnt work so we will only run the stringtie only with our bam file - maybe we all didnt index the same way or didnt use the same reference genome
